# CrystalDock

This Dock was inspired by Silmeria Dock which can be found here: https://www.deviantart.com/mixsilmeria/art/Silmeria-Dock-670809026

I decided I did not like the way I had to add or remove or even interact with the settings and files itself, so I decided to expand and create it from scratch using WPF which is consequently my first WPF applcation.
