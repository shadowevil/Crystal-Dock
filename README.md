 #CrystalDock

This Dock was inspired by Silmeria Dock which can be found here: https://www.deviantart.com/mixsilmeria/art/Silmeria-Dock-670809026

I decided I did not like the way I had to add or remove or even interact with the settings and files itself, so I decided to expand and create it from scratch using WPF which is consequently my first WPF applcation.

Some Features:
 - Snapping to stay inside the screen(s)
 - Location saving, no reason to deal with manipulating numbers to move it around, just unlock drag to where you want, lock again.
 - Able to remove an Entry and have the dock update on the fly
 - Similar icon layout/style as Silmeria Dock with some twists and additions
